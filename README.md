# THIS IS A PERSONAL, NOT USEFUL PROJECT
This is a learning project for me to experiment with the rust language as I learn it. Much of the code will be, to put it simply, bad and will likely not be properly implemented. This is not the point.

This is my first proper github project, and first major experiment with rust, so it is not meant to be useful at this moment. If it approaches a point where it is usable, I may make the repository public. Until then do not use this for anything useful.
