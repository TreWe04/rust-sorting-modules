# rust-sorting-modules

This is a learning project in Rust to view and benchmark different sorting algorithms. This is a personal project as a new Rust dev, so the code will not be fully idiomatic nor well optimized at this stage. 

## Installation

There is no release version, so to run the code install rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), clone the repo, then run the code with "cargo run".
